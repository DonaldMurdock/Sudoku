## Introduction
Sudoku is played on a grid of n<sup>2</sup> by n<sup>2</sup> squares. The grid is further divided into n<sup>2</sup> segments of size n by n. In each square the player must put a number from 1 to n<sup>2</sup> such that each row, column, and segment contains each number from 1 to n^2 with no repeated numbers. Typically, the game is played on 9x9 grid, and each square must be filled with the numbers 1 through 9.
